Documentation including installation instructions and tutorial can be 
found in the Personis/Doc directory.

Open the file Personis/Doc/Personis.pdf for installation instructions 
and tutorials. 

For the impatient, you can install Personis by typing the command "./install.sh" 
in the top level directory. You will get copious output from python as it installs
packages.
